Glaucoma,I-Surgical
surgery,I-Surgical
is,0
the,0
most,0
effective,0
means,0
for,0
lowering,O-Physical
intraocular,O-Physical

typically,O-Physical
to,O-Physical
between,O-Physical

and,O-Physical
15,O-Physical
mmHg,O-Physical
[1].,0
The,0
most,0
common,0
surgical,I-Surgical
approach,I-Surgical
is,0
to,0
drain,I-Surgical
aqueous,I-Surgical
humor,I-Surgical
to,I-Surgical
surrounding,I-Surgical
eye,I-Surgical
tissue,I-Surgical
"(sub-conjunctiva),",I-Surgical
where,I-Surgical
it,I-Surgical
can,I-Surgical
then,I-Surgical
be,I-Surgical
absorbed,I-Surgical
by,I-Surgical
capillaries,I-Surgical
(See,0
Figure,0

The,0
sub-conjunctiva,0
is,0
a,0
thin,0
layer,0
of,0
tissue,0
between,0
the,0
sclera,0
(a,0
tough,0
fibrous,0
opaque,0

sometimes,0
known,0
as,0
the,0

conjunctiva,0
(a,0

of,0
the,0

That,0

A,0
fluid,0
bleb,0
generally,0
forms,0
in,0
this,0

just,0
outside,0

through,0
the,0
sclera,0
from,0
the,0

of,0
the,0

The,0
fluid,0
bleb,0
is,0
predominantly,0
a,0
fluid,0
filled,0
cavity,0
formed,0
when,0
the,0
tissue,0
swells,0
or,0
is,0
displaced,0
by,0
excess,0
fluid,P-Condition

although,0
the,0
bleb,0
may,0
have,0
some,0
internal,0

Typically,0
fibrous,0
tissue,0
(or,0
scarring),0
"occurs,",0
which,0
encapsulates,0
the,0
fluid,0

(and,0
here,0
is,0
referred,0
to,0
as,0
the,0
bleb,0
capsule),0
forming,0
a,0
scar,0
layer.,0
The,0
geometry,0
of,0
this,0
resulting,0
fluid,0
bleb,0
is,0
thought,0
to,0
be,0
a,0
significant,0
determinant,0
of,0
the,0
efficacy,0
of,0
fluid,I-Surgical

by,I-Surgical
the,I-Surgical
sub-,I-Surgical

and,0
so,0
success,0
of,0
the,0
glaucoma,I-Surgical

Consequently,0
bleb,0
grading,0
systems,0
have,0
been,0
developed,0
to,0
predict,0
the,0
long,0

This,0

We,0

a,0

that,0

with,O-Physical
the,O-Physical

the,0

It,0

or,O-Physical
an,O-Physical

generally,O-Physical
led,O-Physical
to,O-Physical
a,O-Physical
lower,O-Physical

An,0
increase,0
in,0
hydraulic,0
conductivity,0
lowers,0
IOP,0
because,0
fluid,0
can,0
move,0
further,0
from,0
the,0

and,0
so,0
involve,0
more,0

The,0
downside,0
of,0
a,0

that,0
more,0

From,0
Figures,0
3,0
and,0
4,0
we,0
surmise,0
that,0
changes,0
in,0
tissue,0
fluid,0
transport,0
properties,0
due,0
to,0
scar,0
formation,0
and,0
vascularization,0
are,0
clearly,0
important,0
to,0
IOP,0
control.,0
In,0
Figures,0
5,0
and,0
6,0
we,O-Other
can,O-Other
conclude,O-Other
that,O-Other
the,O-Other
geometry,O-Other
of,O-Other
the,O-Other
bleb,O-Other
is,O-Other
also,O-Other
critically,O-Other
important.,O-Other
In,0
Figure,0
5,0
height,0
and,0
width,0
of,0
the,0
functioning,0
bleb,0
were,0
both,0
either,0
doubled,0
or,0
"halved,",0
so,0
that,0
the,0
IOP,0
and,0
tissue,0
pressure,0
could,0
be,0
compared,0
in,0
the,0
context,0
of,0
bleb,0
size.,0
That,0
"is,",0
bleb,0
volume,0
was,0
decreased,0
or,0
increased,0
by,0
a,0
factor,0
of,0
eight,0
and,0
the,0
bleb,0
surface,0
area,0
was,0
decreased,0
or,0
increased,0
by,0
a,0
factor,0
of,0
four.,0
It,0
is,0
immediately,0
clear,0
that,0
a,0
small,0
bleb,0
leads,0
to,0
higher,0
IOP,0
and,0
tissue,0
pressure.,0
Again,0
pressure,0
was,0
highest,0
directly,0
above,0
the,0
bleb.,0
This,0
accords,0
with,0
the,0
clinical,0
observation,0
that,0
small,0
blebs,0
often,0
have,0
areas,0
of,0
pallor,0
overlying,0
"them,",0
consistent,0
with,0
a,0
reduction,0
in,0
capillary,0
flow,0

to,0
high,0
tissue,0
hydrostatic,0

Total,0
fluid,0
absorption,0
is,0
directly,0
related,0
to,0
the,0
volume,0
of,0
tissue,0
involved,0
in,0
the,0
absorption.,0
In,0
small,0
"blebs,",0
the,0
fluid,0
must,0
travel,0
further,0
from,0
the,0
bleb,0
before,0
it,0
can,0
be,0
completely,0
absorbed.,0
This,0
fluid,0
movement,0
is,0
limited,0
by,0
the,0
hydraulic,0
conductivity.,0
From,0
Figure,0
5B,0
a,0
larger,0
bleb,0
was,0
predicted,0
to,0
have,0
a,0
controlled,0
"IOP,",0
but,0
at,0
too,0
low,0
a,0
level.,0
Indeed,0
hypotony,0
is,0
a,0
significant,0

of,0

is,0
mostly,0
associated,0
with,0
a,0
lack,0
of,0
definable,0

to,0
the,0
"bleb,",0
thus,0
the,0
bleb,0
is,0
seen,0
to,0
‘run,0
away’,0
(i.e.,0
an,0
uncontrolled,0

in,0

of,0
the,0
bleb).,0
In,0
all,0
"cases,",0
inclusion,0
of,0

In,0
Figure,0

the,0
height,0
and,0

of,0
the,0

are,0
both,0

by,0
a,0

The,0
results,0
of,0

indicate,0
that,0
there,0
is,0
an,0

which,0
would,0
avoid,0
excessive,0

range.,0
The,0
results,0
presented,0
in,0
Figures,0
"3,",0
5,0

all,0
suggested,0
that,0
prior,0
to,0
scar,0

the,0
interstitial,0
fluid,0
pressure,0
in,0
the,0

is,0
highest,0
directly,0

the,0

Once,0
a,0
scar,0
forms,0
this,0
tissue,0
is,0
somewhat,0
protected,0
from,0
high,0

Assuming,0
scar,0
formation,0
is,0
related,0
to,0

we,0
might,0
expect,0
scar,0
to,0
develop,0
first,0
at,0
the,0
top,0
of,0
a,0
bleb.,0
Figure,0

shows,0
bleb,0
and,0

for,0
the,0
case,0
of,0
a,0

of,0

1.5mm,0
sitting,0
above,0
the,0

The,0
shielding,0
of,0
the,0
tissue,0
by,0
the,0
scar,0

is,0
clearly,0
seen.,0
Indeed,0
the,0
highest,0
tissue,0
pressure,0
now,0
occurs,0
next,0
to,0
the,0
outer,0

of,0
the,0

"Presumably,",0
if,0
further,0

were,0
to,0
"occur,",0
it,0
would,0
most,0
likely,0
happen,0
at,0
this,0
outer,0
"edge,",0
causing,0
the,0
scar,0
cap,0
to,0
grow.,0
On,0
the,0
other,0
hand,0
we,0
see,0
that,0
the,0
IOP,0
is,0
similar,0
to,0
that,0
of,0
a,0
scar-free,0
"bleb,",0
despite,0
having,0
a,0
scar,0
cap,0
which,0
is,0
almost,0
70%,0
the,0
radius,0
of,0
the,0
bleb,0
itself,0
(although,0
it,0
does,0
constitutes,0
a,0
smaller,0
component,0
of,0
the,0

and,0
the,0
sub-conjunctival,0
tissue,0
is,0
exposed,0
to,0
lower,0
pressures,0
than,0
the,0
scar-free,0

This,0
suggests,0
that,0
it,0
is,0
the,0
scar,0
formation,0
at,0
the,0
outer,0
sides,0
of,0
the,0
bleb,0
which,0
is,0
most,0
critical,0
to,0
maintaining,0
a,0
stable,0
low,0
IOP.,0

In,0

0.3mm,0
(i.e.,0

It,0
can,0
be,0

a,0

on,0

Recall,0
for,0

it,0
was,0
noted,0
that,0
the,0

of,0

had,0
already,0
occurred,0
within,0
the,0

as,0
the,0

increased,0
the,0

If,0

This,0

In,0

that,0
the,0

a,O-Physical
commensurate,O-Physical

This,0
variation,0
is,0
independent,0
of,0
any,0
likely,0
changes,0
in,0
tissue,0
properties,0
due,0
to,0
scarring,0
and,0
inflammation.,0
If,0
scarring,0
were,0
to,0
"occur,",0
we,0
would,0
expect,0
hydraulic,0
conductivity,0
to,0
decrease,0
and,0
IOP,0
to,0
increase.,0
The,0
current,0
model,0
does,0
not,0
include,0
a,0
pressure,0
dependent,0
change,0
in,0
the,0
hydraulic,0
permeability,0
of,0
the,0
blood,0
vessel,0
walls,0

Although,0
the,0
exact,0
mechanism,0
is,0
still,0
in,0
"debate,",0
there,0
are,0
now,0
several,0
studies,0
that,0
report,0
the,0
reduction,0
in,0
flow,0
in,0
capillaries,0
subjected,0
to,0
external,0
pressures,0
above,0
some,0
threshold,0
(i.e.,0
a,0
critical,0
pressure),0
"[5,13,35].",0
Exceeding,0
the,0
capillary,0
closing,0
pressure,0
with,0
tissue,0
hydraulic,0
pressure,0
would,0
cause,0
the,0
fluid,0
absorption,0
to,0
dramatically,0
decrease,0
(i.e.,0
a,0
decrease,0
in,0
Lp).,0
Although,0
the,0
critical,0
pressure,0
at,0
which,0
capillaries,0
close,0
is,0
not,0
known,0
for,0
sub-,0
conjunctival,0
"tissue,",0
it,0
has,0
been,0
reported,0
that,0
in,0
retinal,0
circulation,0
blood,0
flow,0
is,0
regulated,0
for,0
IOP,0
up,0
to,0
"30mmHg,",0
above,0
30mmHg,0
blood,0
flow,0
decreases,0
[13].,0
Assuming,0
retinal,0
capillaries,0
are,0
at,0
a,0
pressure,0
10mmHg,0
above,0
"IOP,",0
we,O-Other
may,O-Other
estimate,O-Other
the,O-Other
critical,O-Other
pressure,O-Other
as,O-Other
an,O-Other
upper,O-Other
bound,O-Other
of,O-Other
about,O-Other
20mmHg.,O-Other
In,0
this,0
case,0
we,0
may,0
expect,0
the,0
tissue,0
above,0
the,0
small,0
bleb,0
in,0
Figure,0
"3,",0
for,0

to,0
become,0

display,0
a,0
pale,0
pallor,0
and,0
be,0
the,0
site,0
of,0
initial,0
scar,0
formation,0
and,0
lead,0
to,0
the,0
so-called,0
fibrous,0
cap.,0
That,0
"is,",0
pallor,0
of,0
some,0
portion,0
of,0
the,0
bleb,0
"may,",0
"therefore,",0
result,0
from,0
prolonged,0
hydrostatic,0

causing,0
capillary,0
closure.,0
Interest-,0
ingly,0
in,0
the,0
bleb,0
shown,0
in,0
Figure,0
"1,",0
no,0
red,0
capillaries,0
can,0
be,0
seen,0
above,0
the,0
"bleb,",0
either,0
they,0
are,0
beneath,0
the,0
bleb,0
scar,0
surface,0
or,0
blood,0
is,0
unable,0
to,0
pass,0
through,0
them,0
due,0
to,0
capillary,0
collapse.,0
In,0
the,0
clinical,0
situation,0
pale,0
blebs,0
may,0
also,0
arise,0
from,0
chemical,0
"insults,",0
such,0
as,0
the,0
use,0
of,0
the,0
mutagen,0
Mitomycin-C,0
at,0
the,0
time,0
of,0
the,0
surgery.,0
Pallor,0
would,0
seem,0
to,0
be,0
a,0
poor,0
prognostic,0
sign,0
of,0
the,0
functional,0
bleb,0
as,0
a,0
certain,0
level,0
of,0
capillarization,0
is,0
required,0
for,0
the,0
absorption,0
of,0
aqueous.,0
Pale,0
blebs,0
may,0
also,0
develop,0
small,0
leaks,0
through,0
the,0
surface,0
(which,0
clinicians,0
often,0
called,0
‘ooze’),0
a,0
drainage,0
route,0
that,0
is,0
not,0
covered,0
in,0
this,0
"modeling,",0
nor,0
is,0
it,0
clinically,0
desirable.,0
There,0
are,0
always,0
limitations,0
in,0
our,0
understanding,0
of,0
the,0
issues,0
that,0
arise,0
in,0
computational,0
modeling.,0
For,0
"example,",0
issues,0
such,0
as,0
the,0
closing,0
pressure,0
of,0
the,0
capillary,0
bed,0
in,0
the,0
"bleb,",0
the,0
reduction,0
in,0
aqueous,0
production,0
of,0
the,0
eye,0
at,0
high,0
"IOP,",0
the,0
possibility,0
of,0
trans-conjunctival,0
flow,0
releasing,0
aqueous,0
from,0
the,0
absorption,0
route,0
and,0
others.,0
These,0
limitations,0
can,0
be,0
addressed,0
in,0
future,0
"studies,",0
at,0
least,0
once,0
more,0
is,0
known,0
about,0
the,0
mechanisms,0
behind,0
these,0
factors.,0
However,0
the,0
ability,0
of,0
the,0
current,0
model,0
to,0
help,0
understand,0
the,0
physical,0
processes,0
behind,0
the,0
clinically-observed,0
bleb,0
characteristics,0
is,0
an,0
encouraging,0
first,0
step,0
towards,0
enabling,0
a,0
more,0
informed,0
glaucoma,0
surgical,0
"protocol,",0
a,0
better,0
bleb,0
grading,0
"system,",0
and,0
more,0
effective,0
design,0
of,0
implants.,0
In,0
"conclusion,",0
the,0
model,0
contained,0
in,0
this,0
paper,0
has,0
helped,0
illustrate,0
the,0
‘balancing,0
act’,0
required,0
for,0
successful,0
fluid,0
dispersal,0
from,0
a,0
bleb,0
following,0
glaucoma,0
surgery.,0
Generally,0
"small,",0
thick,0
wall,0
blebs,0
are,0
likely,0
to,0
be,0
ineffective,0
at,0
allowing,0
fluid,0
to,0
move,0
into,0
and,0
be,0
absorbed,0
by,0
tissue.,0
These,0
results,0
suggest,0
that,0
small,0
blebs,0
expose,0
tissue,0
to,0
high,0
"pressures,",0
particularly,0
directly,0
above,0
the,0
"bleb,",0
inducing,0
an,0
ischemic,0
tissue,0
remodeling,0
"response,",0
a,0
reduction,0
of,0
hydraulic,0
conductivity,0
and,0
an,0
elevation,0
of,0
IOP.,0
On,0
the,0
other,0
"hand,",0
large,0
blebs,0
are,0
less,0
likely,0
to,0
undergo,0
this,0
remodeling,0
process,0
but,0
may,0
lead,0
to,0
hypotonic,0
eyes.,0
These,0
results,0
are,0
consistent,0
with,0
bleb,0
characteristics,0
seen,0
clinically.,0
